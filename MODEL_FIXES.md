# Model Size and Positioning Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Model Size Problem
**Problem**: The model was appearing either too large or too small due to inconsistent scaling across different components.

**Solution**: 
- Standardized the target size to `2.0` in both `model-viewer.tsx` and `model-viewer-3d.tsx`
- Updated camera positioning to accommodate the new model size
- Adjusted camera distance calculation for better viewing

### 2. Model Orientation Issue ("Sleep" Problem)
**Problem**: The model appeared to be rotated or positioned incorrectly (lying down instead of standing up).

**Solution**:
- Added explicit rotation reset: `scene.rotation.set(0, 0, 0)` to ensure the quarterboard stands upright
- Improved centering logic after scaling

### 3. Text Scaling Issues
**Problem**: 3D text was either too small or disproportionate to the model.

**Solution**:
- Adjusted text scale multiplier from `0.2` to `0.1` for better proportions
- Updated default text size from `0.02` to `0.1`
- Improved bevel settings for better text appearance

### 4. Camera and View Settings
**Problem**: Camera positioning didn't provide optimal viewing angles.

**Solution**:
- Updated main page camera position from `[0, 0, 5]` to `[6, 4, 6]`
- Increased field of view from 50 to 60 degrees
- Updated demo camera position from `[5, 5, 5]` to `[8, 6, 8]`
- Adjusted orbit controls for better interaction

### 5. Grid and Environment
**Problem**: Grid helper was too small for the new model scale.

**Solution**:
- Updated grid size from `[5, 5]` to `[10, 10]` in model-viewer.tsx
- Maintained consistent grid size across components

## Files Modified

1. `app/components/model-viewer.tsx`
   - Model scaling: `targetSize = 2.0`
   - Camera positioning improvements
   - Text scaling adjustments
   - Grid helper size update
   - Rotation reset for proper orientation

2. `app/components/model-viewer-3d.tsx`
   - Consistent scaling with main viewer
   - Rotation reset for proper orientation

3. `app/components/model-viewer-demo.tsx`
   - Camera position update for better viewing

4. `app/page.tsx`
   - Main canvas camera position and field of view updates
   - Text position default adjustment

## Expected Results

- Model should now appear at a reasonable size (not too big or too small)
- Quarterboard should stand upright as intended
- 3D text should be properly proportioned to the model
- Camera should provide good default viewing angles
- Interactive controls should work smoothly

## Testing

To verify the fixes:
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000
3. Check that the quarterboard model appears upright and properly sized
4. Test the 3D text feature to ensure proper proportions
5. Use orbit controls to rotate and zoom the view
